#The Rise and Fall of Bike Sharing in the Covid Era (June 2020 - Dec 2020)#

**Background**

This project is a look at how the NYC lockdown affected demand and use of Citi Bikes throughout the city, as well as the general usage trends from June 2020 to Dec 2020. The inspiration for this project comes from Data Science and analytics Tableau Assignment. The general topics that I looked at were the change in general demand, the stations that were most popular, and the demographics of the people who use the service.

The range of data used in this project is limited to June to Dec of 2020 due to the immense size of the data set.

A summary of our current findings:

*Older people love Citibike.
*There was a massive drop in usage during the COVID-19 lockdown.
*Men are more likely to use Citibike than women. 
*A general picture of the type of people who use Citi Bike has now been outlined. However, where are these people going and how has that changed from June to Dec 2020.

Looking at a dashboard showing the most popular endstations in 2019 vs 2020, an interesting picture is painted. Looking at June 2020, there is a greater concentration in tourist areas near Grove St Path, New Port Pathway, Liberty Light Rail, Hamilton Park.

In stark contrast, 2020 shows a much lower concentration in tourist areas. Instead, we actually see the effect of the free access given to Health care workers. Two of the four highest used end stations were at the New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and the Mt Sinai Hospital. Some of the medium concentrated stations were near the NYU Langone Hospital and the Beth Israel Medical Center. The other stations on the map tended to be near transportation hubs like the Columbus circle train station.
